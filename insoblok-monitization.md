# Insoblok Monitization

💸 1. Transaction Fees (Fixed + Predictable)\
•⁠ ⁠Every on-chain action (vote, post, VTO, NFT mint, trade) generates a fixed micro-fee (e.g., $0.0005), captured in $INSO.\
•⁠ ⁠High-volume engagement (millions of daily micro-actions) = scalable fee revenue.\
•⁠ ⁠Fees go to treasury → redistributed to fund XP/$INSO rewards.

***

🤝 2. Brand & Creator Sponsorships\
•⁠ ⁠Brands pay to run challenges, drops, and “sponsored Looks” within ClosetChain or the leaderboard ecosystem.\
•⁠ ⁠They compete for user attention — users vote → TasteScore validates taste + reach.\
•⁠ ⁠Revenue from these activations funds boosted rewards, prizes, and exclusive creator incentives.

***

🧠 3. AI-as-a-Service & API Monetization\
•⁠ ⁠The TasteScore™️ Engine, Try-On AI, and voting logic will be licensed to:\
o External fashion, personal care, and wellness platforms\
o Web3 projects seeking social reputation layers\
•⁠ ⁠These integrations provide SaaS-like recurring revenue that feeds the reward pool.

🛒 4. Marketplace Commissions\
•⁠ ⁠Peer-to-peer commerce (fashion NFTs, remixed looks, personal care bundles) is transacted via InSoBlok’s native marketplace.\
•⁠ ⁠A small cut (e.g., 2.5%) of each sale goes to the treasury → recycled into $INSO staking rewards and user incentives.

***

🔁 5. Treasury Staking & Protocol-Owned Liquidity\
•⁠ ⁠Platform fees and treasury allocations are partially staked or used to provide liquidity.\
•⁠ ⁠Yield from staking validators and DEX pools helps offset reward emissions without inflating token supply.
