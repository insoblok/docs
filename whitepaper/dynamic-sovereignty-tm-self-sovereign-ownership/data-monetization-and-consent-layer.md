# Data Monetization & Consent Layer

In a world where user data drives trillion-dollar markets, Dynamic Sovereignty restores **agency and monetization rights** to the individual. InSoBlok AI embeds a **consent-driven data monetization framework** into the protocol core:

* Users define **granular permissions** over how their on-chain behavior, taste signals, and profile metadata can be accessed or sold
* AI agents **negotiate on behalf of the user** to license anonymized behavioral data for fashion analytics, campaign optimization, and product feedback loops
* **All monetized data streams are transparent**, on-chain, and tied back to the original contributor via their DID + TasteScore index

This unlocks a **new data economy** where the user-not the platform-captures the value of their insights and attention.
