# TasteScore™ as a Sovereign Reputation Layer

Dynamic Sovereignty is deeply integrated with **TasteScore™**, InSoBlok’s AI-driven reputation protocol that transforms **influence into programmable trust**. In this system:

* **Identity is verified not just by documentation but by taste, behavior, and social impact**.
* **Reputation is earned** by voting, creating, and participating--and **expressed through a score that unlocks access, rewards, and governance rights**.
* High-TasteScore users benefit from **enhanced privacy tiers, zero-gas transaction windows, and early access to premium drops**.

Unlike Web2 where influence is siloed and monetized by platforms, TasteScore in InSoBlok AI is **user-owned, composable across dApps**, and enforces reputation-aware logic in every transaction-from NFT minting to DAO votes.
