# Private Identity Models

To ensure maximum privacy without sacrificing utility, InSoBlok AI supports a multi-mode identity stack:

* **Anonymous Mode**: Allows interaction with apps and voting systems without revealing wallet or profile linkage
* **Pseudonymous Mode**: Enables influencer-like branding with optional DID connection and protected IP
* **Verified Mode**: Connects real-world credentials for RWA ownership, brand licensing, or event access

Each mode includes **TasteScore segmentation**, so social influence is preserved while **contextual privacy boundaries** remain intact.
