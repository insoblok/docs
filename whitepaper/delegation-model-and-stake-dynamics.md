# Delegation Model and Stake Dynamics

InSoBlok AI enables token holders to participate in consensus via **delegated staking**, aligning passive users with active validators in a mutually beneficial economic loop.

**Delegation Mechanics:**

* **Delegators** can stake $INSO tokens to any active validator of their choice.
* **Delegated stake** boosts the validatorâ€™s selection power and share of network throughput.
* **Rewards** are split proportionally between validator and delegators based on:
  * Validator uptime & performance
  * Community governance participation
  * TasteScore and XP levels

AI-driven delegation dashboards help users choose **high-performing, high-integrity validators**, using real-time metrics and predictive indicators derived from on-chain data and community feedback.
