# Algorithmic Model

The TasteScore engine is powered by a **multi-factor algorithm** that synthesizes:

* **Behavioral input signals** (e.g., voting history, engagement velocity)
* **Social graph analytics** (e.g., interactions with high-TasteScore accounts)
* **Contextual content evaluation** (e.g., fashion quality, uniqueness, remix lineage)
* **AI feedback loops** (e.g., generative AI interpreting style coherence or sentiment)

TasteScore is calculated using a **weighted composite model**:

TasteScore = f(Engagement \* Style Quality \* Social Trust \* Influence Spread)

Each variable is adjusted in real-time via machine learning models that ingest **on-chain events**, **AI-enhanced metadata**, and **cross-account interaction patterns**.
