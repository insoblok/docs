# Purpose & Vision

TasteScore™ was conceived to solve three core challenges in today’s creator and influencer economy:

* **Lack of context-aware social reputation**: Followers and likes offer no verifiable signal of actual influence, taste, or contribution.
* **Platform-dependent authority**: Reputation today is siloed in Web2 platforms, non-transferable and unverified.
* **Low-fidelity feedback loops**: Existing systems fail to reward nuance, style innovation, or early trend identification.

In contrast, TasteScore enables a **self-sovereign reputation layer** that lives on-chain, evolves with user behavior, and directly drives **monetary opportunity, governance power, and social discovery**.
