# Privacy, Tamper Resistance & Zero-Knowledge Integrity

To preserve fairness and security:

* Scores are **calculated off-chain** in ZK-compatible environments and anchored to chain via **hash commitments**
* Users may **prove their TasteScore bracket (e.g., Top 10%)** without revealing exact values
* All source interactions used for scoring are cryptographically signed to prevent forgery

This ensures the system is **non-gameable, fair, and privacy-respecting**, even under competitive monetization models.
