# Economic Utility & Monetization Rights

In a system driven by creativity and taste, **reputation becomes collateral**. TasteScore is used to:

* **Gate access to creator monetization modules** (e.g., NFT launch, P2P token sale, affiliate engine)
* **Prioritize content in discovery feeds** across Lookbooks, VTO galleries, and remix feeds
* **Enable fashion designers or health influencers to launch branded drops** backed by trust
* **Power creator DAOs**, where TasteScore multiplies governance voice in style councils or campaign selections

Over time, TasteScore becomes the **dynamic price oracle for attention, influence, and co-creation rights**.
