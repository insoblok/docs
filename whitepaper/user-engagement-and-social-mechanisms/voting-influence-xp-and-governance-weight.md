# Voting Influence, XP & Governance Weight

TasteScore is linked to **on-chain XP (Experience Points)**, which accumulates through meaningful contributions. XP is non-transferable and acts as a **soul-bound metric**. XP levels directly affect:

* **Governance vote weight** in protocol proposals and funding allocation
* **Eligibility for token airdrops, ambassador roles, or branded campaigns**
* **Access tiers** to exclusive creator tools or smart contract functions

High TasteScore + XP users serve as **cultural validators**-recognized not for how loud they are, but how aligned their aesthetic is with the evolving taste of the network.
