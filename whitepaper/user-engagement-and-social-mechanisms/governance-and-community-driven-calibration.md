# Governance & Community-Driven Calibration

TasteScoreâ€™s parameters are not fixed. They are upgradable through:

* **Community-approved DAO proposals**
* **AI-informed feedback loops**, analyzing manipulation trends and evolving aesthetic patterns
* **Quadratic governance input**, where more users with moderate TasteScores can offset whale influence

This keeps the engine honest, responsive, and **socially anchored-not plutocratically distorted**.
