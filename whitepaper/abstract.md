# Abstract

The landscape of blockchain technology is very much aligned with Tim Berners-Lee's idea of the World Wide Web (Semantic Web) is its universality. The power of a hypertext link is that "anything must be able to link to anything".  Blockchain has evolved significantly, with more than a decade of history shaping its trajectory. Over this time, we have witnessed numerous challenges obstructing the widespread adoption of blockchain in various promising sectors, including DeFi, gaming, entertainment, metaverse, real estate, healthcare, banking, and micro transactions applicable to so many other verticals. Among these challenges, the high cost of transactions, slow transaction speeds, and the complex process of introducing new users to the blockchain ecosystem have stood out as significant hurdles. These challenges must be addressed so blockchain technology can be adopted at a larger scale to attract billions of users.
