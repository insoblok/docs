# Interoperability & Governance Extension Layer

To support future expansion, the Dynamic Sovereignty Architecture includes a **modular governance bridge layer** powered by:

* **Polkadot Substrate runtime integrations**
* **Cosmos IBC-based consensus syncing**
* **DID-based cross-chain identity mapping**

This allows TasteScore, DID credentials, and engagement records to **flow across blockchain ecosystems**, enabling:

* Global reputation that spans across platforms
* Inter-chain governance voting
* Federated creator economies with consistent identity
