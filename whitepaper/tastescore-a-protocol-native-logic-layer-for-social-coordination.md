# TasteScore: A Protocol-Native Logic Layer for Social Coordination

Where traditional blockchains focus on consensus and throughput, InSoBlok introduces **TasteScore™ as a native social consensus mechanism**-a system that captures cultural relevance, peer validation, and aesthetic intuition into an on-chain score that governs:

* **Access to perks, early drops, and premium commerce tools**
* **Curation power across the platform (e.g. voting outcomes, leaderboard rankings)**
* **Monetization multipliers based on social value creation**
* **Influencer-brand matchmaking based on TasteScore signals and past performance**

TasteScore is fully embedded into the protocol’s identity layer, reputation logic, and smart contract execution paths-ensuring that every post, vote, or interaction has **economic and governance significance**. It enables a **proof-of-taste economy** where influence isn’t just earned-it’s **measured, tradable, and rewarded**.

By anchoring itself in proven code while layering in deep innovations in AI, tokenization, and social UX, **InSoBlok AI becomes more than a chain**-it becomes an adaptive, composable, and culture-aware **platform layer for the intelligent, decentralized internet**.
