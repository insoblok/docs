# InSoBlok Approach

InSoBlok approach to build the blockchain is simple and efficient in terms of choosing a battle-tested blockchain as its starting point and doing improvements and changes to the protocol to achieve the business goals that InSoBlok envisions around speed, cost, and user onboarding. For this InSoBlok is to be built on top of the Go Ethereum codebase that is already audited, running in production, and very well tested and trusted by millions. InSoBlok will make changes to the protocol to ensure:

1\. It is always cheap for the end users

2\. Fast to build nice user experiences with quick response times

3\. Secure and fool proof so that brands and projects build on InSoBlok with confidence

4\. Scalable enough to accommodate billions of users to the ecosystem

5\. On top of everything, we aim to have 0 carbon footprint, that is by using the infrastructure that runs purely on green energy.

&#x20;

To achieve all this, we have carefully decided what exact changes are required at protocol level including block time, block size, transaction fees, block rewards, consensus mechanism and so on. Further details for the protocol level changes are explained in the following section under â€˜Protocol Enhancements.
