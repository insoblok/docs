# Development Tools

### Smart Contracts

&#x20;Smart contracts development with Endurance enables you to build your smart contracts for any use, including cryptocurrency exchanges, smart contract-based dApps, and more. Smart contracts are programming logic that are executed automatically when a certain condition(s) are met. In Endurance, smart contracts can be written in the Solidity programming language. Please refer to the official documentation of Solidity for any queries.

### IDE&#x20;

Multiple IDEs and libraries can be used for developing and deploying smart contracts.

* Remix IDE: A powerful open-source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser. It is written in JavaScript and supports both browser-based and local usage. Remix IDE has modules for testing, debugging, deploying smart contracts, and much more.
* IntelliJ Solidity Plugin: Every aspect of IntelliJ IDEA has been designed to maximize developer productivity. Together, intelligent coding assistance and ergonomic design make development not only productive but also enjoyable.
* Chainide: A Cloud-Based Multi-Chain IDE.&#x20;

### Development Framework

* Truffle: A world-class development environment, testing framework, and asset pipeline for blockchains using the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
* Embark: Embark is a platform that enables easy development and deployment of decentralized applications.
* Waffle: The most advanced framework for testing smart contracts.
* OpenZeppelin: OpenZeppelin provides security products to build, automate, and operate decentralized applications. We also protect leading organizations by performing security audits on their systems and products.
* HardHat: Hardhat is a development environment for Ethereum software

### Solidity Code Quality

* Solhint: This is an open-source project for linting Solidity code. This project provides both Security and Style Guide validations.
* Ethlint: Ethlint (Formerly Solium) analyzes your Solidity code for style & security issues and fixes them.
* Manticore is a symbolic execution tool for analyzing smart contracts and binaries.
* Slither: Slither is a Solidity static analysis framework.
* &#x20;Echidna: Echidna is a program designed for fuzzing/property-based testing of Ethereum smart contracts.&#x20;

### Front-End Programming

* Web3.js: Access full node capabilities without running your own.
* Ethers.js: Designed to make it easier to write client-side JavaScript-based wallets, keeping the private key on the ownerâ€™s machine at all times.



### Back-End Programming

* Web3.py: A Python interface for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem.
* &#x20;Web3.php: A PHP interface for interacting with the Ethereum blockchain and ecosystem. Native ABI parsing and smart contract interactions.
* Scala Web3: Scala and Android library for integration with Ethereum clients.
* Go Lang: Bringing the love of Go to Ethereum. An open-source GO Lang integration library for blockchain.
* Ruby Web3: Ethereum library for the Ruby language.

### Wallet SDK

* &#x20;Venly: Wallet creation by social accounts.
* &#x20;Sequence.app: Wallet creation by social accounts.
* Web3Auth: Wallet creation by social accounts.
* BSC Connector: This example demonstrates how to support the Binance Chain Wallet through a custom connector.

### Multisig

* Gnosis: The purpose of multisig wallets is to increase security by requiring multiple parties to agree on transactions before execution.
