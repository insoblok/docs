# ay/Nay Voting™: Instant Feedback, On-Chain Signal

Fashion, personal care, and wellness are subjective-but TasteScore quantifies taste through **community-powered voting**.

* **Live Polls**: Users can initiate Yay/Nay polls on any VTO or post. Followers and friends vote anonymously, contributing to the item's score.
* **XP Boosting**: Consistently participating in voting earns XP. Being aligned with the majority consensus or predicting future trends increases one’s TasteScore faster.
* **Cultural Indexing**: Yay/Nay data is aggregated into trend graphs, enabling influencers, brands, and DAOs to discover emerging aesthetics and product hits early.

This mechanism makes style validation transparent, fun, and tokenizable-bridging subjective expression with on-chain trust.
