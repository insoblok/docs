# ClosetChain™: Virtual Try-On as Gameplay

ClosetChain™ is the world’s first blockchain-native, AI-powered try-on system, turning fashion and personal care discovery into a social game.

* **Multi-Source Input**: Users can select items to VTO from NFT-based Marketplace items, livestream screenshots, URL uploads, or their personal photo albums.
* **Try-On Engine**: AI renders the item onto the user’s avatar or uploaded image using advanced pose estimation and style transfer techniques.
* **Gamified Prompting**: After each VTO, users are prompted to post the look to their Lookbook, initiate a Yay/Nay poll, or remix the style for a new TasteScore-earning opportunity.

Every successful VTO adds to the user’s TasteScore, with bonus points for originality, trend-setting, and community engagement.
