# Swipe-to-Earnâ„¢: Discover, React, Earn

Inspired by Gen Z-friendly UX patterns like TikTok and BeReal, InSoBlok introduces a **Swipe-to-Earn** interface where users can explore content rapidly while earning rewards.

* **Swipe Interface**: Users swipe through community VTOs, Looks, and Style Remixes.
* **Quick Reactions**: Voting, saving, sharing, or remixing a post generates TasteScore points.
* **Micro-Actions, Macro Impact**: The more authentically users engage with posts (i.e., not bots or spam), the more weight their reactions have-backed by AI verification.

Swipe-to-Earn transforms social browsing into active value generation, with TasteScore acting as the meta-currency of recognition.
