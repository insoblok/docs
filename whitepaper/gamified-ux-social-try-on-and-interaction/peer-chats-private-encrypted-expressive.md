# Peer Chats: Private, Encrypted, Expressive

SocialFi should feel like a real conversation, not just a comment thread. InSoBlok integrates **end-to-end encrypted chats** that are:

* **Metadata Private**: Powered by ZK-based routing, chats retain no metadata trails-only sender/receiver validation.
* **Rich & Expressive**: Share emojis, stickers, GIFs, VTO previews, or even micropayments via $INSO.
* **P2P Commerce Embedded**: Users can send VTOs for approval, split digital purchases, or co-own NFTs directly through chat.

These peer connections foster intimacy and trust, turning followers into communities-and communities into DAO-led microeconomies.
