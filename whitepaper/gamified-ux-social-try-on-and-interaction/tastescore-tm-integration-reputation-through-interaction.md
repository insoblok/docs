# TasteScore™ Integration: Reputation Through Interaction

All gamified UX layers are unified under **TasteScore™**, which acts as the glue between activity and reputation. The more a user engages meaningfully-with style, substance, or support-the higher their TasteScore climbs.

| **Action**                     | **TasteScore Boost**                     |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Posting a VTO                  | +5 to +20 (based on originality + votes) |
| Participating in Yay/Nay Polls | +2 to +10 (accuracy weighted)            |
| Starting a Style Remix Chain   | +10 (multiplies with each remix)         |
| Peer-to-Peer Chat Engagement   | +1 to +5 (verified and sustained convo)  |
| Swipe-to-Earn Reactions        | +0.5 per action (capped daily)           |

These micro-rewards fuel macro growth: high TasteScore users get **priority visibility, campaign eligibility, governance power**, and brand collaboration offers.
