# Fixed Transaction Fees: Predictable Costs for Scalable Commerce

One of the core limitations of traditional Layer 1 protocols is **variable and often prohibitive transaction costs**. Fluctuating gas fees create uncertainty for developers and hinder scalability for transaction-intensive applications such as social voting, creator monetization, and micro-commerce.

InSoBlok AI addresses this challenge by implementing a **predictable, fiat-pegged fixed fee model**:

* Every transaction on the network costs a **capped $0.0005 USD equivalent**, regardless of the market volatility of the native $INSO token.
* This fixed fee is made possible through an **on-chain/off-chain oracle mechanism** managed by the InSoBlok Foundation, which continuously updates token price data and dynamically adjusts gas conversion rates to preserve fiat equivalence.

By decoupling gas fees from token market fluctuations, InSoBlok enables:

* Sustainable business model planning
* High-frequency creator engagement
* Frictionless onboarding for billions of mainstream users
