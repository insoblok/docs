# High-Speed Finality: A 3-Second Global Social Chain

User experience is paramount in SocialFi, where real-time interaction defines utility. InSoBlok AI is optimized for **maximum responsiveness**, with:

* **Block times capped at 3 seconds**
* **Instant finality mechanisms** to reduce UI latency
* **Concurrent transaction execution** to support complex social actions like Virtual Try-Ons (VTO), Yay/Nay voting, and tokenized swaps

This architecture ensures that decentralized applications (dApps) built on InSoBlok deliver **the same or better responsiveness than Web2 platforms**, but with the benefits of transparency and on-chain verifiability.
