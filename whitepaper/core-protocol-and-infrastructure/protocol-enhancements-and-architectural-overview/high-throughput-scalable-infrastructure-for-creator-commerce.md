# High Throughput: Scalable Infrastructure for Creator Commerce

To support global-scale SocialFi and e-commerce transactions, InSoBlok AI employs a **30 million gas-per-block configuration**, balancing block complexity and computational throughput. In combination with the rapid block time, this configuration enables:

* Real-time virtual try-on rendering
* Large-scale Yay/Nay voting events
* Creator monetization via dynamic NFT minting

The architecture is intentionally extensible, designed to support millions of daily users executing varied transaction types-from image uploads and social votes to full-fledged P2P payments and smart contract settlements.
