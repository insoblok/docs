# TasteScore™ as a Protocol Logic Layer

Beyond traditional consensus mechanisms, InSoBlok introduces **TasteScore™-**&#x61;n AI-enhanced, on-chain reputation system that acts as a programmable social layer woven directly into the protocol. TasteScore affects:

* **Discovery Algorithms**: Higher TasteScores result in greater content visibility.
* **Governance Influence**: Voting weight and DAO proposal authority are linked to user TasteScores.
* **Token Rewards**: XP and $INSO earnings are influenced by a user’s validated social impact.
* **Transaction Flexibility**: In future iterations, users with high TasteScores may be prioritized for certain zero-gas interactions.

By embedding **reputation-weighted consensus** into the system, InSoBlok AI evolves from a transactional network into a **culturally-aware economic layer**, where users with aesthetic and social influence are recognized not just by metrics-but by protocol logic itself.
