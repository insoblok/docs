# Fair Transaction Ordering: First-Come, First-Served Logic

To eliminate front-running and ensure equitable access for all users, InSoBlok AI adopts a **first-come, first-served (FCFS)** transaction ordering model. With no fee-based prioritization or bidding system:

* Validators **process transactions strictly in the order received** from the mempool.
* This ensures **equal opportunity for all creators and users**, regardless of the size or funding level of their project.

This approach is especially critical in use cases involving public voting, influencer drop events, and gamified content, where timing must be fair and manipulation-proof.
