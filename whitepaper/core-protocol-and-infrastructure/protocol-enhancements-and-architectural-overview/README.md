# Protocol Enhancements & Architectural Overview

InSoBlok AI is architected from the ground up to serve the evolving needs of a decentralized, creator-centric economy-where reputation, influence, and ownership are key primitives of both interaction and value. To achieve this, the protocol introduces a series of enhancements to the base-layer blockchain architecture. These enhancements are specifically designed to optimize for four foundational pillars: **cost-efficiency**, **speed**, **equity**, and **scalability**-while incorporating **TasteScoreâ„¢** as a system-native logic engine that governs everything from transaction prioritization to token economics.

Rather than building entirely from scratch, InSoBlok AI strategically extends the **Go Ethereum (Geth)** codebase-an open-source, production-proven, and extensively audited foundation that powers much of the existing Web3 ecosystem. This decision allows InSoBlok to retain compatibility with a vast library of EVM-based tools while introducing key protocol-level innovations that unlock new dimensions of social and economic interaction.
