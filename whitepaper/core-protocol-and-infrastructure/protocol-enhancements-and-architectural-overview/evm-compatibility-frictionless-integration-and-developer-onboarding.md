# EVM Compatibility: Frictionless Integration and Developer Onboarding

To ensure rapid adoption and maximize ecosystem interoperability, InSoBlok AI maintains full **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility**, including:

* Solidity-based smart contract execution
* Integration with popular dev tools (e.g., Hardhat, Remix, Truffle)
* Compatibility with wallets like MetaMask and WalletConnect

This enables any developer familiar with EVM chains to **instantly deploy and scale** on InSoBlok AI, and for existing projects to expand or migrate with minimal friction.

1. **Validator Selection, Staking, and Delegation**

To ensure a secure, scalable, and culturally aligned consensus model, InSoBlok AI implements a **hybrid consensus mechanism** that combines **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)** with an innovative **Proof of AI Contribution (PoAC)** layer. This hybrid design not only delivers high throughput and energy efficiency but also incorporates **behavioral intelligence and social reputation** as core inputs into validator incentives, selection, and accountability.

This framework enables InSoBlok AI to support its mission as a **socially dynamic, AI-native Layer 1-**&#x77;here trust is not just computational, but also **reputation-aware and influence-weighted** through integrated metrics like **TasteScoreâ„¢** and XP (experience points).
