# AI-Powered Execution & Tokenization Infrastructure

InSoBlok AI redefines what is possible at the smart contract layer by embedding **AI intelligence natively into the execution environment**. Beyond simply facilitating transactions, InSoBlokâ€™s execution layer operates as an **autonomous, adaptive orchestration engine**, capable of optimizing transaction flow, predicting usage spikes, and adapting governance logic in real time.

Built on an **Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)-compatible framework**, InSoBlok AI provides developers with a familiar interface while introducing a powerful set of AI-driven primitives designed to meet the complex demands of **SocialFi, creator economies, and tokenized commerce** at scale.
