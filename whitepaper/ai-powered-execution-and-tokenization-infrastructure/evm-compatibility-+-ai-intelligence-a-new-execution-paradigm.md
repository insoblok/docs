# EVM Compatibility + AI Intelligence: A New Execution Paradigm

InSoBlok AIâ€™s smart contract environment maintains full EVM compatibility-ensuring seamless migration and interoperability for existing dApps, tooling, and developer ecosystems. However, this layer goes far beyond standard Solidity execution.

By integrating **reinforcement learning**, **graph-based reasoning**, and **predictive analytics models**, InSoBlok enables the next evolution of smart contracts-ones that can:

* Optimize their own gas expenditure
* Adapt to real-time demand and latency
* Prevent contract-level exploits using anomaly detection and simulation
* Dynamically adjust reward logic based on user behavior and system metrics

These capabilities allow for **self-tuning smart contracts** that evolve with the network and provide **autonomous decision-making** at scale, removing the need for frequent manual upgrades and reducing governance friction.
