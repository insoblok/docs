# Validator Incentives in an AI-Orchestrated System

InSoBlok AI moves beyond the limitations of inflationary block rewards by introducing a **fee-based validator economy**-augmented by AI-tuned yield models and behavioral scoring.

| **Feature**                      | **Functionality**                                                                                | **AI-Driven Innovation**                                    |

| **Transaction Fee Rewards**      | Validators and delegators earn real-time fees from protocol activity                             | Tied to real utility, not inflation                         |
| **Proportional Distribution**    | Rewards scaled based on stake, uptime, and TasteScore-weighted governance participation          | Aligns incentives with performance and community reputation |
| **Dynamic Yield Adjustments**    | AI analyzes usage patterns and adjusts validator rewards in real-time                            | Incentivizes load balancing and high-value node behavior    |
| **Reputation-Based Multipliers** | High TasteScore or XP unlocks tiered rewards, reducing the power of capital-only validator sets. | Makes staking more inclusive and culture-aligned            |

This economic framework ensures that **network security is balanced with social legitimacy**-rewarding not just performance, but also the validator’s relationship to the ecosystem’s values and creative participants.
