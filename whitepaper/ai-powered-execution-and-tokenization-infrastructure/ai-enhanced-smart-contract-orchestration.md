# AI-Enhanced Smart Contract Orchestration

InSoBlok’s AI infrastructure includes a multi-agent system that supports intelligent execution routing, contract pre-processing, and behavioral forecasting.

**Key Capabilities:**

* **Adaptive Transaction Routing**:\
  Contracts automatically select the most cost-efficient and performant routes across InSoBlok’s modular Layer 1 and Layer 2 environments. Reinforcement learning models continuously assess network conditions to minimize latency and optimize user experience.
* **Decentralized Load Balancing**:\
  Validator nodes are dynamically assigned workloads based on current capacity, historical reliability, and projected demand. AI agents optimize this distribution to prevent bottlenecks and ensure high throughput even under congestion.
* **Energy-Aware Execution Logic**:\
  Smart contracts adjust their consensus participation based on overall network activity and validator availability. AI models detect ideal times to defer or batch computation, significantly reducing InSoBlok AI’s environmental footprint while maintaining system security.
