# TasteScore™ Integration: AI Personalization + Social Reputation in Execution

InSoBlok AI embeds **TasteScore™ directly into the execution infrastructure**, allowing smart contracts to dynamically adapt logic based on **user reputation, influence, and behavioral patterns**.

Examples include:

* **Differential Transaction Handling**: High TasteScore users receive prioritized settlement on certain dApps, or reduced wait times in queue-based voting systems.
* **Smart Contract Personalization**: NFT drops, commerce offers, and rewards dynamically shift based on the TasteScore, engagement rate, or fashion category alignment of the user.
* **Reputation-Weighted Tokenization**: When minting digital assets, the protocol adjusts rarity tiers or scarcity multipliers based on a creator’s cumulative TasteScore and XP.

TasteScore integration allows **on-chain logic to reflect off-chain influence**, bridging social and computational trust in a programmable and permissionless way.
