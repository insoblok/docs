# AI-Driven Tokenization of Real World and Digital Asset

The InSoBlok infrastructure supports **frictionless tokenization** of both physical and digital assets through intelligent abstraction layers. Smart contracts can mint, manage, and price assets using dynamic data feeds, including:

* Market demand forecasts
* Social voting outcomes (e.g., Yay/Nay ratios)
* AI-generated style trend projections
* On-chain usage data (e.g., frequency of Virtual Try-Ons)

This unlocks novel capabilities:

* **Self-pricing NFTs**: Items update their price floor based on virality or rarity metrics.
* **Dynamic Fashion Collections**: Digital wardrobes evolve with seasons, trends, and TasteScore-weighted feedback loops.
* **AI-backed fractional ownership**: Luxury fashion or beauty routines can be co-owned and resold using programmable token splits, governed by community demand signals.
