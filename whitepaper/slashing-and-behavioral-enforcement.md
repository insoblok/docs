# Slashing & Behavioral Enforcement

To protect the protocol against malicious or negligent behavior, InSoBlok AI implements **intelligent slashing conditions** triggered by both **technical violations** and **social dishonesty**.

**Slashing Triggers:**

* Double signing or downtime
* Misuse of delegated funds
* Algorithmically flagged manipulation (e.g., reward gaming)
* Negative TasteScore drop below protocol thresholds

In addition, validators can be **downgraded or excluded** from special programs (e.g., influencer collabs, governance committees) based on sustained poor XP or TasteScore performance.
