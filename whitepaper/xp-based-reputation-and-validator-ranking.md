# XP-Based Reputation and Validator Ranking

InSoBlok AI introduces **XP (Experience Points)** as a native, non-transferable metric that tracks behavior and contribution across the protocol. XP affects:

* **Validator visibility and discoverability**
* **Reward multipliers in staking payouts**
* **Eligibility to participate in advanced governance roles**

XP is earned through:

* High block production uptime
* Active participation in TasteScoreâ„¢-weighted voting
* Honest behavior during protocol upgrades
* Support of ecosystem tools, educational content, or dispute resolution

Validators with higher XP are rewarded not just economically but with **increased trust and influence** across the InSoBlok ecosystem.
