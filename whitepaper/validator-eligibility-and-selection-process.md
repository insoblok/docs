# Validator Eligibility and Selection Process

Validator participation is governed by an **on-chain, decentralized election protocol** where validator candidates must pass both objective and reputation-based thresholds.

**Selection Criteria:**

* **Stake Threshold**: Validators must stake a minimum amount of $INSO tokens to be eligible.
* **Community Voting**: Existing validators cast weighted votes. A new candidate must receive **>50% approval** to be admitted.
* **Reputation Gatekeeping**: AI systems evaluate each candidate’s **XP history**, **uptime**, **past governance behavior**, and **TasteScore™-linked community alignment** before entry into the active set.

This **multi-layered eligibility model** ensures that new validators are not only technically capable but also socially validated and behaviorally incentivized.
