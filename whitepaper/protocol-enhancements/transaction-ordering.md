# Transaction Ordering

In the InSoBlok blockchain, we have a fixed fee model for the transactions, so the transactions are processed on a first com,e first serve basis. This is also because we want to give a fairplay ground for everyone no matter what the size of the project. The protocol ensures that the validator who is sealing the block picks the transactions in the order they are received in the transaction mempool.

Within the InSoBlok blockchain, our approach to transaction fees adopts a fixed fee model, ensuring that transactions are processed on a straightforward "first come, first serve" basis. This deliberate choice aligns with our commitment to providing a level playing field for all participants, regardless of the size or scale of their projects.

To implement this approach, the protocol is structured to ensure that the validator responsible for sealing a block follows the chronological order of transactions as they are received in the transactions mempool. This means that transactions are processed in the sequence in which they enter the system, enhancing transparency and equitable access to the blockchain's processing capabilities.

### Native Gas Token

&#x20;Like any blockchain, InSoBlok is to have its native token INSO with a hard cap on maximum supply. This INSO token is going to have a lot of other utilities on top of its native purpose, that is to serve as the gas token for the transactions.
