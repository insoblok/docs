# Fixed Fee

One of the key challenges that most blockchains have is the variable and expensive fees to process the blockchain transactions. Due to the varying nature of the transaction fee based on the network gas price, no one can predict the future costs of running a sustainable application, particularly where the volume of the transactions is huge.

This is one of the fundamental promises of the InSoBlok Chain to address this pain point with predictable and fixed fees for the transactions with regards to dollar value rather than the native gas token price. This ensures that in the event of the gas token market price reaching higher values like 10x or 100x for example, the end user will still pay as low as $0.0005 for any transaction settled on the InSoBlok Chain.
