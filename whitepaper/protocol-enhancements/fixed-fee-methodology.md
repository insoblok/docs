The solution to this challenge lies in the proactive approach of the InSoblok Foundation. The foundation undertakes the responsibility of calculating the INSO token price by leveraging various on-chain and off-chain data sources. Through a meticulous process of data validation and cleansing, the foundation computes the market price of the INSO token. This calculated price is then seamlessly integrated into the protocol, establishing a dynamic and adaptive system that adjusts transaction charges based on real-time market conditions.
