# TasteScore™-Weighted Governance & Rewards

n addition to XP, **TasteScore™** serves as a **social-reputation layer** that enhances validator influence in areas where aesthetic alignment, community sentiment, and cultural impact matter.

Validators and delegators with high TasteScores benefit from:

* **Enhanced reward multipliers**
* **Governance weight in creator economy tooling (e.g., ClosetChain drops, fashion token approvals)**
* **Priority access to influencer collaborations and ecosystem campaigns**

This system ensures that **technical security** is balanced with **cultural sensitivity**, aligning validator behavior with the social layer of InSoBlok AI.
