# Horizontally Scalable Infrastructure

To onboard billions of users, InSoBlok AI must operate at global scale without compromising experience. The architecture introduces:

* **Layer 1 optimizations** for parallelized execution
* **Modular Layer 2 rollups** for specialized workloads (e.g., LookBook, VTO, or TasteScore consensus)
* **State channels and edge caching** for latency minimization in high-frequency interactions

This layered approach provides both scalability and functional isolation-allowing personalized AI agents and tokenized content to scale independently while maintaining a consistent state view.
