# Ultra-Low, Predictable Costs for End Users

A core mandate of InSoBlok is to ensure blockchain interaction is not cost-prohibitive. The protocol implements **fee capping and subsidy mechanisms** to maintain an ultra-low fixed cost of **$0.0005 per transaction**, regardless of network congestion. This enables:

* Micro-transactions
* NFT minting at scale
* Real-time commerce flows
* Frictionless UX for mobile and casual users

By eliminating price volatility at the transaction layer, InSoBlok AI becomes viable for creators and consumers in regions where gas costs would otherwise be a barrier.
