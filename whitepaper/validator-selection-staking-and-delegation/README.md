# Validator Selection, Staking, and Delegation

InSoBlok AI employs a hybrid consensus model that combines Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) with Proof of AI Contribution (PoAC) to ensure a scalable, efficient, and AI-powered validation process.

Selection Process

* Validators are chosen through a decentralized on-chain voting system where existing validators vote on new participants.
* Candidates must receive more than 50% of the existing validator votes to be eligible for selection.

Staking & Delegation Model

* Validators must stake a minimum amount of $INSO tokens to be eligible for participation.
* Delegators can stake their tokens with a validator to earn a proportional share of the transaction fees generated.
* AI-driven analytics continuously assess validator performance, contribution, and engagement to optimize delegator rewards.
