# Validator Rewards & Incentives

Unlike conventional blockchain ecosystems that rely on inflationary block rewards, InSoBlok AI implements a **dynamic transaction fee distribution model** anchored by AI-optimized incentives to maintain economic stability and foster network participation. The synergy of DPoS and PoAC within InSoBlok AIâ€™s validator mechanism ensures a robust, adaptable, and secure consensus layer, fostering an ecosystem where trust, transparency, and technological efficiency are paramount.

| **Transaction Fee-Based Rewards**    | Validators and delegators earn real-time transaction fees, eliminating reliance on inflationary block rewards.                                | Reduces long-term inflation, ensuring sustainable tokenomics.                                     |
| **Proportional Reward Distribution** | Rewards are algorithmically distributed based on stake weight, validator performance, and contribution to network security.                   | Adaptive scaling of rewards based on validator efficiency and delegator engagement.               |
| **AI-Optimized Yield Model**         | AI models dynamically adjust yield rates by analyzing on-chain data, transaction volume, and validator reputation scores.                     | Real-time yield adjustments based on predictive analytics and performance metrics.                |
| **Reputation-Based Incentives**      | Continuous evaluation of validators through AI-driven reputation scoring, factoring uptime, governance participation, and protocol adherence. | Reputation scores influence reward multipliers, promoting honest behavior and network resilience. |
