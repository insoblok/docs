# Core Components

* **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI):** InSoBlok AI integrates advanced SSI frameworks, leveraging Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) compliant with W3C standards. Identity data is cryptographically secured using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to ensure privacy-preserving, tamper-proof identity verification. Users maintain exclusive control over their credentials without reliance on centralized authorities.



* **AI-Assisted Adaptive Governance:** Governance dynamics are governed by AI-driven consensus models that incorporate reinforcement learning and federated machine learning algorithms. These models continuously analyze on-chain behavioral patterns and external socio-economic data to optimize participation incentives, adjust governance policies, and enhance system resilience against adversarial activities.



* &#x20;**Secure Tokenized Ownership:** The tokenization framework employs smart contracts based on ERC-1400 and ERC-1155 standards, supporting fractional ownership, programmable compliance, and dynamic asset management. Tokenized assets, including RWAs and NFTs, are secured through cryptographic hashing, multi-signature authorization protocols, and on-chain escrow mechanisms, ensuring immutable proof of ownership and transfer integrity.
