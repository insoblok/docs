# Developer Experience, IDEs & Deployment Tools

From testing contracts locally to launching on mainnet, InSoBlok supports the full development lifecycle:

* Real-time mainnet + testnet RPC endpoints
* Faucet for test tokens via CLI or UI
* Automated CI/CD pipelines for contract deployment
* Built-in TasteScore integration for reputation-linked feature gating (e.g., early access for high-XP users)
