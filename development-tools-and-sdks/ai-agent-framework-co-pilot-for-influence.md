# AI Agent Framework: Co-Pilot for Influence

InSoBlok AIâ€™s Agent SDK enables autonomous or semi-autonomous agents to act on behalf of influencers, creators, or brands. These agents can:

* Auto-suggest trending VTO items based on TasteScore & style similarity
* Pre-schedule Yay/Nay voting for LookBook content
* Monitor engagement metrics to generate optimal post timing
* Execute AI-assisted brand/influencer smart contracts
* Recommend XP-maximizing actions for reputation progression

Agents operate on-chain and off-chain using ZK-compliant privacy models to ensure trustless execution and personal data protection.
