# Integration APIs for Brands, Creators & Influencers

To lower the barrier for Web2 companies and digital creators, InSoBlok provides RESTful and GraphQL-based APIs that enable:

* Access to TasteScore and XP metrics
* Publishing content (posts, VTOs, comments) on behalf of users
* Fetching on-chain wardrobe and ClosetChainâ„¢ metadata
* Triggering Yay/Nay polls and parsing results
* Tracking campaign engagement, voting outcomes, and reward distribution

These APIs allow influencer networks, creator platforms, and brand dashboards to integrate directly with InSoBlok AI without needing deep blockchain expertise.
